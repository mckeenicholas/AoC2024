# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

### 25 days, 25 languages (hopefully)

| Day | Language | Notes                                                                                         |
|-----|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | SQL      | Definitely not made for this sort of stuff, did have to preprocess                            |
| 2   | Bash     | Also not made for this sort of stuff                                                          |
| 3   | Racket   | The bane of all Waterloo first years                                                          |
| 4   | Elixir   | Pipe operator is really nice                                                                  |
| 5   | Haskell  | A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors...                                        |
| 6   | Scala    | Seems like a functional language with the boilerplate of java...                              |
| 7   | Pascal   | I miss regex (also ints being 16 bits really threw me off)                                    |
| 8   | Ruby     | Probably my shortest solution so far, conciseness of Ruby definetly helps.                    |
| 9   | R        | 1-indexed arrays are certainly a choice...                                                    |
| 10  | Zig      | Somehow it was easier to install and run on Windows. I still really like the language though. |
