# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

### 25 days, 25 languages (hopefully)

| Day | Language | Notes                                                                   |
|-----|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | SQL      | Definitely not made for this sort of stuff, did have to preprocess      |
| 2   | Bash     | Also not made for this sort of stuff                                    |
| 3   | Racket   | The bane of all Waterloo first years                                    |
| 4   | Elixir   | Pipe operator is really nice                                            |
| 5   | Haskell  | A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors...                  |
| 6   | Scala    | Seems like a functional language with the boilerplate of java...        |
